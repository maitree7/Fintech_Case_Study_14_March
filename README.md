## Background about SALT

**SALT** stands for **Secured Automated & Lending Technology**

SALT was founded in 2016 by a group of Bitcoin enthusiasts who aimed to prove that people didn’t need to compromise their lifestyle or forego their needs in order to pursue a long term outlook on cryptocurrency. Salt introduced asset backed lending to the cryptocurrency marketplace, providing a new level of versatility to digital asset holders.

**Shawn Owen**, a graduate from Southern Utah University was the co-founder & CEO for SALT till 2018.

Salt Lending Holdings, Inc is a Private company headquartered in Denver, Colorado. Salt Lending Holdings, Inc has received a total of $1.5M in funding. Currently, SALT Lending has expanded to 46 U.S. states and also operates in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Vietnam and more.

## Idea Behind SALT
SALT is a membership-based financing ecosystem. 

SALT revolves around the company’s trademarked Blockchain-Backed Loans. Blockchain-Backed Loans are simply loans in which you hand over a blockchain asset, like Bitcoin, as collateral in exchange for traditional currencies. Unlike traditional auto or home loans, you can use these loans for any personal or business expense.

SALT is automated, cost-effective, transparent and cryptographically secure. This allows their Members to plan tax events, and maintain their long position in a chosen blockchain asset.

SALT's globally available asset-backed financing solution empowers liquidity providers to manage the risk of lending to a rapidly expanding, underserved and immediately addressable borrower base.

## Business Activities

**Problem in existing Financial Lending Industry**
* Less Flexibility in Lending
  Because of financial regulations in place, those with lower credit scores have a harder time obtaining a loan
* Slower Application Process
  Because there are so many rules, regulations, and face-to-face meetings to fill out paperwork and submit documents, the application time is slower and more tedious than with digital lenders. Digital lenders have a more streamlined approach but still follow the same process to identify the most qualified borrowers with the least amount of hassle.
* Inconvenience
  Banks are typically only open during standard business hours, which makes it hard for many working people, especially on time sensitive banking matters.
* Processing Costs & Fees
  Processing Cost / Loan Application Fees is a fee charged to a potential borrower for processing an application for a loan and are intended to pay for all the costs of the process of loan approval.

  **Intended Market**

  **SALT Lending Process**
  Users buy membership to the Salt Lending platform by purchasing Salt, which is the platform's cryptocurrency. 
  Salt is built on an ERC-20 smart contract. ERC-20 is a standard that any Ethereum token contracts must implement, in order to facilitate the exchange of tokens

  When someone becomes a member, they can borrow money from an extensive network of lenders. Borrowers put up bitcoin, ether, ripple and other blockchain assets as collateral. 
  This is because Salt Lending, instead of determining the eligibility of a borrower by focusing on their credit score, grants eligibility on the value of the borrower's blockchain assets. 
  Because of this, approval is fast. Salt keeps collateral assets safe in a "fully-audited, ultra-secure architecture during the life of the loan so members can borrow with confidence," according to their [website]

  Borrowers are charged interest on the loan, as they would be on any other loan. However, unlike other loans, when a borrower pays it off, they receive their blockchain-backed assets back.
