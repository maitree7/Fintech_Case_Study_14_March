## Business Activities

**Problem in existing Financial Lending Industry**
* Less Flexibility in Lending
>  Because of financial regulations in place, those with lower credit scores have a harder time obtaining a loan
* Slower Application Process
>  Because there are so many rules, regulations, and face-to-face meetings to fill out paperwork and submit documents, the application time is slower and more tedious than with digital lenders. Digital lenders have a more streamlined approach but still follow the same process to identify the most qualified borrowers with the least amount of hassle.
* Inconvenience
>  Banks are typically only open during standard business hours, which makes it hard for many working people, especially on time sensitive banking matters.
