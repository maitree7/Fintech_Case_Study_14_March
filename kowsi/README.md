## RESULT

### Key Factor

2. **Fast** – The loan approval speed is usually higher than in traditional loans. Although this may vary between lenders, it is mostly a faster alternative than going through a traditional lender.
3. **Opportunity to get passive income** – Bitcoin hodlers can earn extra income by lending their crypto to borrowers as they wait for the markets to be favorable
